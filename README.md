Danfo is an ELSH axis variable font with three main styles at 0,50, and 100. Danfo covers all of the Google SSA character set. The three styles reflect different cut-out shapes inspired by the vinyl cut-out lettering of the public transportation buses in Lagos, Nigeria.

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://Afrotype.github.io/danfobase.
